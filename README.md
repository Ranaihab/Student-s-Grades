# Student-s-Grades
Program to check whether the students passed or failed the exam. It is implemented using mpi.

You have a list of students' ids with their exam grade at a course written in a file. Some of them
will pass and some wonâ€™t pass. This depends on their grades if the grade was greater than or
equal 60 they will pass otherwise they will be asked to repeat the exam.

It is a parallel program implemented using mpi library and the tasks are:<br />
  Master process (rank 0)<br />
			- Read data from file<br />
			- Divide the students list by the number of processes you have then send it to them.<br />
    - Print the summation of the number of passed students received from each process.<br />
  For each process<br />
    - Receive part of students data<br />
    - Check if they passed or not and print message for each student<br />
      <Student ID> Passed The Exam<br />
      <Student ID> Failed. Please Repeat The Exam<br />
    - Calculate number of passed student then send it to master process (rank 0)
